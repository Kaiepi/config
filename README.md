# Config

This contains my configuration files for UNIX-like systems. This is a minimal
i3-based X.org setup with UTF-8 xterm and dark, colourful, high-contrast
theming.

## Installing

1. Install the following packages:
  - zsh
  - vim
  - git
  - i3
  - i3status
  - rofi
  - feh
2. Set up X.org with the [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) font family.
3. Follow the instructions for installing the [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) vim plugin.
4. Pick a background to use and save it as `~/background.jpg` (not sure if mine's copyrighted...).
5. You should be good to go by this point! If not, raise an issue.
