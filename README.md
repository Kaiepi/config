# Config

This contains my configuration files for UNIX-like systems. This is a minimal
i3-based X.org setup with UTF-8 xterm and dark, colourful, high-contrast
theming.

## Installing

1. Install the following packages:
    - zsh
    - vim
    - git
    - i3
    - i3status
    - rofi
    - feh
2. Install the following (or remove their related `PATH`s from `.zshenv` and vim plugins in `.vim/vimrc`):
    - Haskell
    - Racket
    - OpenJDK 11
    - Raku (to `$HOME/.raku`)
    - Idris (to `$HOME/.idris`)
    - Idris 2 (to `$HOME/.idris2`)
3. Set up X.org with the [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) font family.
4. Follow the instructions for installing the [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) vim plugin.
5. Pick a background to use and save it as `~/background.jpg` (not sure if mine's copyrighted...).
6. You should be good to go by this point! If not, raise an issue.
